## FreMEn
We propose a smarter preventive measure by an AI based mechanism that regulates the number of people in an area at any instance of time. FreMEn app “Nebojsa” will advice you when to visit a public place, through its AI based FreMEn engine that will predict precisely where will the crowd form.

## Smart Cough
We propose a smarter way to detect if you have high probability of having COVID-19. Record your cough sound and see if you have corono cough. We have now lauched our data recording Application.

## Covid Tracing
Our application uses Bluetooth to scan the area around the device for other app users and saves the data of these encounters. Once the user is covid positive, the health authorities can send him a code with which he can send us his data to cloud. A csv file is uploaded in our Database. Our Web gui can crosscheck the tuids of user contacts from csv and Database and tell us the details of user meeting.
